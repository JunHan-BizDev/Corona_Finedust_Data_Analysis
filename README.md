## conclusion 

 Since the arrival of the coronavirus, the trend of using **private economy**, or private services, even if it costs more, has been noticeable.
 Industries in the `increasing cluster` generally had many private services centered on members. Thus, a significant increase in sales can be achieved by proposing membership-based services to the industry, which is a `declining cluster`, including hotel, movie theater, gym club, fitness center and so on.
